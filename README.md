# Airbnb Clone (In React JS)

# Description
* A clone of Airbnb, but built using React JS.
* Motivation: Replicate something that I had done previously in Ruby on Rails, in a new framework, but with guidance before I attempted my own project.
* Learnings: How to plan out the React components to develop, and how to use State and Effect hooks

# Credits
* This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app)
* I was following this [Le Wagon tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ZTT9kw3PIE). Although the syntax has changed since 6 years ago, the concepts in the video still remain relevant, so I wrote the code using the latest React 18 syntax.
